# User-Defined-Primitives-UDP-
Designing an 8 to 1 multiplexer using two 4 to 1 multiplexers and a 2 to 1 multiplexer and using a 5-input majority circuit

Tasks:
1. Write code for 2 to 1 MUX using UDP
2. Write code for 4 to 1 MUX using UDP
3. Write code for 8 to 1 MUX by instantiating both 4 to 1 MUX and 2 to 1 MUX as needed
4. Write Test Bench file for the 8 to 1 MUX
5. Using UDP, design a 5-inputs majority circuit, the circuit has 5 inputs X1, X2, X3, X4, and X5 and one
   output Z1, the value of the output is 1 when the majority of inputs are 1s, thatâ€™s it, otherwise output is 0.
   Write a Verilog code for this circuit then write its Test Bench file.
